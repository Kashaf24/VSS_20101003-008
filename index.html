<h1>A Road Trip To Murree</h1>
<p>
    Murree is a great visiting hill station that is located in Pakistan at the outs. From a distance, it looks more of a fantasy city. The place is visited by different people from different nations since it shields one from the sweltering heat. Though I am adventurous, I had never visited any hill station before. However, a few months ago, I planned to visit Murree. I had always heard stories about its beauty. I had always wished for that moment to be in Murree and experience this peaceful environment, and yes, my desire came true.
    Well, on that day, we reached Murree with my friend at around 3.00 p.m. to me it was the best day of my life. The journey to Murree was quite different from the one am used to in the plains. Life around Murree is expensive. The cost of the hotels is too high for the ordinary man, but luckily we got a very dark bungalow at a reasonable price. Being too tired, we chose to rest and begin our adventures on the next day.
    Though the trip was short, I experienced the wonders that nature holds that make Murree flourish. The area was all green, below it were streams and brooks that went down the mountains. The mountains were cool, and no amount of the sun heat disturbed us no matter how much it was. Around birds chirped in a rhythm that seemed to be singing welcome songs to us. Some monkeys swayed from tree to tree, seemingly waiting for any visitor to offer them some food. The landscapes were distinctly inspiring, Murreeâ€™s neighborhood was satisfying. At Murree, we visited a theme park in Nathia Gali, and it was both wondrous and adventurous. There were many varieties of beautiful flowers and enticing ferns, and the smell of the flowers was pleasing, and I kept breathing in the scent from time to time. The nature of Nathia Gali seemed awakened, it looked like it had a magic touch. To me, this was a very new experience thus I watched everything closely with rapt attention.

    The day ended, and we had to go back to the bungalow and wait for the next day so that we could travel home. On our way back, dark clouds were visible in the sky, and as a result, it rained heavily. On arrival to the bungalow, we were heavily drenched, and the only option was having some hot coffee. Throughout the night, there was a heavy downpour, but luckily when morning came, the rained had stopped. The sun rose gracefully, and it was time to travel back. Along the way, one could see a golden light lighting the mountains. The view was nothing less than fascinating.
    
    To sum everything up, Murree is the best place that I have ever visited all my life. Till date, I still consider Murree as a fantastic place.
